          As a web developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and
          design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design
          to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications
          that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing
          engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

          probably reading books, travelling or playing video games.
